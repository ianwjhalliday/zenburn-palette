# Zenburn Palette

A palette visualization of the Vim [Zenburn](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/)
color scheme.

While porting the theme over to Visual Studio I decided I wanted to see all
the colors in an easy-to-view, all-in-one-place palette.

I realize there are existing ports to Visual Studio, but they all seem to
stray from the original Zenburn's syntax highlighting choices.  Or maybe they
mimic older versions of Zenburn?  I don't care enough to dig into why.  They
just don't match what I see in Vim, so I'm working on make a faithful straight
port.
